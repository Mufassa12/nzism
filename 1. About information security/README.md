1.1. Understanding and using this Manual
Objective
1.1.1.
The New Zealand Information Security Manual details processes and controls essential for the protection of all New Zealand Government information and systems. Controls and processes representing good practice are also provided to enhance the baseline controls. Baseline controls are minimum acceptable levels of controls and are often described as “systems hygiene”.

Context
Scope
1.1.2.
This manual is intended for use by New Zealand Government departments, agencies and organisations. Crown entities, local government and private sector organisations are also encouraged to use this manual.

1.1.3.
This section provides information on how to interpret the content and the layout of content within this manual.

1.1.4.
Information that is Official Information or protectively marked UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE or RESTRICTED is subject to a single set of controls in this NZISM.  These are essential or minimum acceptable levels of controls (baseline controls) and have been consolidated into a single set for simplicity, effectiveness and efficiency.  

1.1.5.
All baseline controls will apply to all government systems, related services and information. In addition, information classified CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET or TOP SECRET has further controls specified in this NZISM.

1.1.6.
Where the category “All Classifications” is used to define the scope of rationale and controls in the Manual, it includes any information that is Official Information, UNCLASSIFIED, IN-CONFIDENCE, SENSITIVE, RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET or any endorsements, releasability markings or other qualifications appended to these categories and classifications.

The purpose of this Manual
1.1.7.
The purpose of this manual is to provide a set of essential or baseline controls and additional good and recommended practice controls for use by government agencies.  The use or non-use of good practice controls MUST be based on an agency’s assessment and determination of residual risk related to information security.

1.1.8.
This manual is updated regularly.  It is therefore important that agencies ensure that they are using the latest version of this Manual.

Target audience
1.1.9.
The target audience for this manual is primarily security personnel and practitioners within, or contracted to, an agency.  This includes, but is not limited to:

security executives;
security and information assurance practitioners;
IT Security Managers; 
Departmental Security Officers; and
service providers.
Structure of this Manual
1.1.10.
This manual seeks to present information in a consistent manner.  There are a number of headings within each section, described below.

Objective – the desired outcome when controls within a section are implemented.
Context – the scope, applicability and any exceptions for a section.
References – references to external sources of information that can assist in the interpretation or implementation of controls.
Rationale & Controls 
Rationale – the reasoning behind controls and compliance requirements.
Control – risk reduction measures with associated compliance requirements.
1.1.11.
This section provides a summary of key structural elements of this manual.  The detail of processes and controls is provided in subsequent chapters.  It is important that reference is made to the detailed processes and controls in order to fully understand key risks and appropriate mitigations.

The New Zealand Government Security Classification System
1.1.12.
The requirements for classification of government documents and information are based on the Cabinet Committee Minute EXG (00) M 20/7 and CAB (00) M42/4G(4).  The Protective Security Requirements (PSR) INFOSEC2 require agencies to use the NZ Government Security Classification System and the NZISM for the classification, protective marking and handling of information assets.  For more information on classification, protective marking and handling instructions, refer to the Protective Security Requirements, NZ Government Security Classification System.

Key definitions
Accreditation Authority
1.1.13.
The Agency Head is generally the Accreditation Authority for that agency for all systems and related services up to and including those classified RESTRICTED.  See also Chapter 3 – Roles and Responsibilities and Section 4.4 – Accreditation Framework.

1.1.14.
Agency heads may choose to delegate this authority to a member of the agency’s executive.  The Agency Head remains accountable for ICT risks accepted and the information security of their agency. 

1.1.15.
In all cases the Accreditation Authority will be at least a senior agency executive who has an appropriate level of understanding of the security risks they are accepting on behalf of the agency.

1.1.16.
For multi-national and multi-agency systems the Accreditation Authority is determined by a formal agreement between the parties involved.  Consultation with the Office of the Government Chief Digital Officer (GCDO) may also be necessary.

1.1.17.
For agencies with systems that process, store or communicate NZEO or information compartmented for national security reasons, the Director-General of the GCSB is the Accreditation Authority irrespective of the classification level of that information.

Certification and Accreditation Processes
1.1.18.
Certification and accreditation of information systems is the fundamental governance process by which the risk owners and agency head derive assurance over the design, implementation and management of information systems and related services provided to or by government agencies.   This process is described in detail in Chapter 4 – System Certification and Accreditation.

1.1.19.
Certification and Accreditation are two distinct processes.

1.1.20.
Certification is the formal assertion that an information system and related services comply with minimum standards and agreed design, including any security requirements.

1.1.21.
In all cases, certification and the supporting documentation or summary of other evidence will be prepared by, or on behalf of, the host or lead agency.  The certification is then provided to the Accreditation Authority.

1.1.22.
Accreditation is the formal authority to operate an information system and related services, and requires the recognition and acceptance of associated risk and residual risks.

1.1.23.
A waiver is NOT an exception (see below).  A waiver is the formal acknowledgement that a particular compliance requirement of the NZISM cannot currently be met.  A waiver is granted by the Accreditation Authority on the basis that full compliance with the NZISM is achieved or compensating controls are implemented within a time specified by the Accreditation Authority.  Waivers are valid in the short term only and full accreditation cannot be granted until all conditions of the waiver have been met.  The need for a waiver may occur when specified controls cannot be practically implemented because of technology, resource or other serious limitations.  It is essential that risk is managed through the application of specified conditions.

1.1.24.
An exception is NOT a waiver (see preceding paragraph).  An exception is the formal acknowledgement that a requirement of the NZISM cannot be met and that a dispensation from the particular compliance requirement is granted by the Accreditation Authority.  This exception is valid for the term of the Accreditation Certificate or some lesser time as determined by the Accreditation Authority.  This may occur, for example, the system is to be in use for a very short time (usually measured in hours), or the requirement cannot be met and there is no viable alternative.  It is essential that any consequential risk is acknowledged and appropriate measures are taken to manage any increased risk.

1.1.25.
The requirements described above are summarised in the table below.  Care MUST be taken when using this table as there are numerous endorsements, caveats and releasability instructions in the New Zealand Government Security Classification System that may change where the authority for accreditation lies.
